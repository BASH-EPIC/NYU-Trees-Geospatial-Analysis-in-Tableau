The information also enables researchers to examine the many varieties of trees found in New York's urban ecology and investigate the distinct advantages (or lack thereof) of various species. According to the 2005 census, there are 168 species of street trees in the city, with the London Planetree accounting for about 15% of them. Why is that particular species so numerous? It seems there is no scientific basis for this. Robert Moses, a city planner, merely liked them. Because of the census and the realization that an ecosystem is too vulnerable when there is a high concentration of any one species, Parks NY has started focusing on boosting diversification. Other species include the tough Ginkgo tree, which accounts for around 3% of the total, and the sour seed pods of which, in areas like Washington Square Park, cover city streets.

Parks NYC can improve biodiversity and foresee how particular trees can negatively effect a neighborhood by understanding the distribution of tree species. For instance, Staten Island has a large population of Callery Pear trees, a species that is unwelcoming to birds and other animals that support a healthy ecology and loses limbs quickly, increasing the likelihood that they may cause damage to property. They also have a foul scent.
